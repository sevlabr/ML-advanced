Both parts are dedicated to building Machine Translation models.

[Part 1](https://github.com/sevlabr/ML-advanced/tree/main/NLP%20Lab/Part%201) is about unsupervised embedding-based approach.

In [part 2](https://github.com/sevlabr/ML-advanced/tree/main/NLP%20Lab/Part%202) it was proposed to try at least 3 different
approaches to build a Seq2Seq Neural MT system from Russian to English language and reach desired BLEU score.
